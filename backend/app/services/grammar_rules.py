**English Grammar and Spelling Guidelines**

1.  **Clarity and Conciseness**: Strive for clear and concise language. Avoid jargon and overly complex sentences.
2.  **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Ensure that subjects and verbs agree in number (e.g., "the dog barks," not "the dog bark").
3.  **Correct Tense Usage**: Use the appropriate verb tense for the context (past, present, future).
4.  **Punctuation**:
    *   Use commas to separate items in a list.
    *   Use a period to end a declarative sentence.
    *   Use a question mark to end a question.
    *   Use an exclamation mark for emphasis.
5.  **Spelling**: Double-check for spelling errors. Use a spell-checker if necessary.
6.  **Capitalization**: Capitalize the first word of a sentence and proper nouns (names of people, places, organizations).
7.  **Sentence Structure**: Avoid run-on sentences and sentence fragments. Each sentence should have a clear subject and verb.
